### Requirements
While developing you will need:
- [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli)

For deployment install:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [AWS-CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- [Serverless CLI](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs-getting-started)

### Running the application
Once we are done with configuration, you will have two choices to start the app:
- WHEN WORKING LOCALLY: ``bash local.sh`` will start a local (!DEVELOPMENT!) server which listens on Port 8080
or
- WHEN DEPLOYING: ``bash docker.sh`` will run the same application with a propper WSGI and
a production-ready Nginx web-server

Before we can do that, there is just a bit more configuration to do:
- Setup and connect our database
- Configure Stripe
- Create an OAuth application for authentification
- setup emails

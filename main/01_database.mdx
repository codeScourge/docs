title: "Database"
---

RDBs (Relational Databases) have been dominating the space since the 80s. Back then the main concern 
was storage, which is why RDBs are designed to avoid duplication by normalizing data. 
As you might guess, compute is now the major bottleneck. 
Thats where NoSQL databases like DynamoDB come in. They are:

##### 1. faster and more reliable than RDBs
NoSQL databases are optimized for speed. You can retrieve items in miliseconds and don't have to use expensive join
operations.

##### 2. dirt cheap and scale to the moon
You can use on-demand pricing or provision a database starting at 0.95$ per month. They can be scaled virtually unlimited
since sharding allows them to scale horizontaly.

##### 3. easier to use
DynamoDB is fully managed. You will never have to worry about scaling, provisioning, security, backups, rollbacks, and
everything else that comes along with a self-hosted database. 

Here is an [awesome post discussing the strenghts and applications of NoSQL databases](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/11bpfen/comment/ja3itzd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

If this is the first time leaving the world of RDBs, the whole mindset of building table schemas will be
quite confusing. However, getting used to it is definetily worth it.
Check out [this webinar on modeling data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMEkNZby95M) before you continue.

Now we will set up your database. While we could have done so programmatically in our IAS (Infrastructure
as Code) template, I prefer not accidentaly delete my database when playing around in the CLI (I am speaking from experience).

For this follow the steps shown in [this Introduction to DynamoDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k2GINpO308)
and manually create a table. Otherwise you can follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHeYz-C9hSk&list=PL9nWRykSBSFi5QD8ssI0W5odL9S0309E2&index=12)
and deploy it locally, but you will have to change the code accordingly.

Set the primary key as email and leave the search key empty, as this is how we are going to find our users. Also
add a string property called ``package_id``, more on this later.

Now lets dive into the code and see how we interact with our database. 
Open ``backend/db.py`. 
As you can see, we establish a connection to our table based on its name, which is saved in an environment variable.
Add the name you just created to ``.env``.

```python db.py
# --- setup Client ---
def get_dynamo_table():
    if "dynamo_table" not in g:
        g.dynamo_table = boto3.resource("dynamodb").Table(os.getenv("DYNAMO_TABLE_NAME"))
    return g.dynamo_table

dynamo_table = LocalProxy(get_dynamo_table)
``` 

To do that we use the AWS SDK for Python boto3. This requires that you have setup the AWS-CLI (see installation).
What follows are a bunch of helper functions, including the ``add_user`` function I mentioned in the last chapter.


```python db.py
def add_user(email:str):
    """ If the email does not already exist, we add the user to our table """
    dynamo_table.put_item(    
        Item={
            "email": email,
            "package_id": 0
        },
        ConditionExpression='attribute_not_exists(pk)'
    )
```

We use a "ConditionExpression" to only add a user, if he does not yet exist. As you can see, each new user has a 
"package_id" key set to 0. What it does is represent what package the user has bought:
- 0 = none
- 1 = cheap package
- 2 = expensive package

This can then be used to only allow the user to access certain content, if he ahs bought the according package.
Our ``payment_required`` decorator does exactly this:

```python db.py
def payment_required(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def decorated_func(*args, **kwargs):
        logged_in, payed = check_user_status()

        if logged_in and payed:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        
        if logged_in and not payed:
            return redirect("/")

        return redirect("/authenticate")

    return decorated_func
```

The check_user_status only returns True, if the user has a "package_id" that is higher than 0.
When the user buys a package, we change the "package_id" in his Item to the according number, using our
``set_user_package`` function. To see when and how it is invoked, read the next chapter on payments.

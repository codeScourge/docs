title: "Emails"

Programmatic emails are a pain in the ass. Modern tools make it slightly better.
Instead of writing HTML tables, we  can now use an open-source library called 
[React Email](https://github.com/resend/react-email).
Here we can define our email structure with beatifully styled React components and then compile them into a plain HTML
file. This file can then be used by our Flask backend to send it to users through SES.


### Setting up SES
Already have a Domain? If not, now you will need one. Buy one directly in AWS or "import" it to Route53 using nameservers. 
For example if you have bought your domain from GoDaddy, follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRSj2n-XKGM),
the process is fairly similar at other providers.

title: "Database"
---

RDBs (Relational Databases) have been dominating the space since the 80s. Back then the main concern when
storing data was storage, which is why RDBs are optimized to use up as little space by normalizing data
to avoid duplication. As you might guess, nowadays storage is not a problem anymore - compute is now the
major bottleneck. Thats where NoSQL databases like DynamoDB come in. They are:

##### 1. faster and more reliable than a RDB
NoSQL databases are optimized for speed. You can retrieve items in miliseconds and don't have to use expensive join
operations.

##### 2. dirt cheap and scale to the moon
You can use on-demand pricing or provision a database starting at 0.95$ per month. This can be scaled virtually unlimited
since the NoSQL database are made to shard and can by that scale horizontaly.

##### 3. are easier to manage 
DynamoDB is fully managed. You will never have to worry about scaling, provisioning, security, backups, rollbacks, and all
the stuff that comes along with a self-hosted database. 

Here is an [awesome post discussing the strenghts and applications of NoSQL databases](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/11bpfen/comment/ja3itzd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

If this is the first time leaving the world of RDBs, the whole mindset of building table schemas will be
quite confusing. However, getting used to it is definetily worth it.
Check out [this webinar on modeling data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMEkNZby95M) before you continue.

Now you need to set up your database. While we could have set it up programmatically in our IAS (Infrastructure
as Code) Framework SLS, I prefer the peace of mind that you won't accidentaly delete your database when playing around
with your CLI.

For this follow along the steps shown in [this Introduction to DynamoDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k2GINpO308)
and manually create a table. Otherwise you can follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHeYz-C9hSk&list=PL9nWRykSBSFi5QD8ssI0W5odL9S0309E2&index=12)
and deploy it locally, you will have to change the code accordangly.

Set the primary key as email and leave the search key empty, as this is how we are going to find our users. Also
add a string property called package_id, more on this later.

Now lets dive into the code and see how we interact with our database. 
Open ``db.py`` to see that we establish a connection to our table based on its name, add it to ``.env`` under 
the "DYNAMO_TABLE_NAME" key.

```python db.py
# --- setup Client ---
def get_dynamo_table():
    if "dynamo_table" not in g:
        g.dynamo_table = boto3.resource("dynamodb").Table(os.getenv("DYNAMO_TABLE_NAME"))
    return g.dynamo_table

dynamo_table = LocalProxy(get_dynamo_table)
``` 

To do that we use the AWS SDK for Python boto3. This requires that you have setup the AWS-CLI (see installation).
What follows are a bunch of helper functions, including the ``add_user`` function I mentioned in the last chapter.


```python db.py
def add_user(email:str):
    """ If the email does not already exist, we add the user to our table """
    dynamo_table.put_item(    
        Item={
            "email": email,
            "package_id": 0
        },
        ConditionExpression='attribute_not_exists(pk)'
    )
```

We use a "ConditionExpression" to only add a user, if he does not yet exist. As you can see, each new user has a 
"package_id" key set to 0. What it does is represent what package the user has bought:
- 0 = none
- 1 = cheap package
- 2 = expensive package

This can then be used to only allow the user to access certain content, if he ahs bought the according package.
Our ``payment_required`` decorator does exactly this:

```python db.py
def payment_required(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def decorated_func(*args, **kwargs):
        logged_in, payed = check_user_status()

        if logged_in and payed:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        
        if logged_in and not payed:
            return redirect("/")

        return redirect("/authenticate")

    return decorated_func
```

The check_user_status only returns True, if the user has a "package_id" that is higher than 0.
When the user buys a package, we change the "package_id" in his Item to the according number, using our
``set_user_package`` function. To see when and how it is invoked, read the next chapter on payments.

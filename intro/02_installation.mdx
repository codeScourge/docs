title: "Installation / Setup"

### Requirements

Something everyone will have to install is
- Bun
- Python
- Bash

For deployment you will need
- Docker
- AWS-CLI
- Serverless CLI


### Running the application
Almost done, before we start, we need to bundle our static files, 
since these are not tracked by git which means they will be missing after
a fresh pull.
For that we can run
- ``bun run build`` for JS
- ``bun run tailwind`` for CSS

After that we are ready to start: 
- ``bash local.sh`` will start a local (DEVELOPMENT!) server and host it on Port 8080
or
- ``bash docker.sh`` which will run the same application with a proper webserver, this is slow - use 
local if possible

Unfortunately there is just a bit more configuration to do before we start:
- Setup and connect our DynamoDB database on AWS (or locally)
- Connect Github so User's can authenticate
- Configure our application to be used a webhook for Stripe

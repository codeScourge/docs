title: "Authentication"

The routes can check whether someone is already logged in by searching for the access key (and email) in the local session. 

If it is empty, the user can be redirected to "/authenticate" from where he will go to a page hosted by the OAuth provider and can sign in there.  

After that he is redirected back to our "/callback" route which is defined both in the code and on our GitHub application settings. The request parameters now hold a code which can be traded for an access token, we can now safe it in the session.  

Now we can retrieve the email from GitHub using our access_token, which allows us to query our DynamoDB table based on the email (our Primary Key).

If this email does not yet exist in our DynamoDB table, we add it.

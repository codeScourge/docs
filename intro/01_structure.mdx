title: "Project Structure"
---

Let's start with the big picture: the project structure.

Open the ``backend`` folder.
As a Flask developer you will immediately see a familiar pattern:
- a ``static`` folder holding your CSS and JS
- a ``templates`` with your HTML Jinja templates
- our Flask application in ``app.py``
- a ``requirements.txt`` file for our python dependencies
- a ``gunicorn_config.py`` file which configures our Gunicorn WSGI
- a Dockerfile to containarize the application for easier development and deployment

One thing is missing though: the ``.env`` file. Create one in the ``backend`` folder, we will fill it
throughout the documentation.

If you open the ``static`` we see another familiar pattern: src (source) and
dist (distination). When bundling our JavaScript, the raw code is being transpiled into a clean bundle and 
copied from src to dist. After that we can simply import it into our HTML just like any other JavaScript.

```html landing.html
<script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='dist/landing.js') }}" defer></script>
```

How is it done? Open ``bundle.js`` in our root directory. Here we can see how Bun
tracks defined JavaScript files and creates bundles with the same name.

```js bundle.js
await Bun.build({
    entrypoints: [
        "./backend/static/source/authenticated_home.js", 
        "./backend/static/source/payed_home.js", 
        "./backend/static/source/landing.js"
    ],
    outdir: "./backend/static/dist/",
})
```
Try executing this file with ``bun build.js``. 
It is also defined as a script in our ``package.json`` and can be ran using ``bun run build``.

```json package.json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "bun build.js",
    "tailwind": "bunx tailwindcss -i ./backend/static/source/globals.css -o ./backend/static/dist/tailwind.css",
    "watch-tailwind": "bunx tailwindcss -i ./backend/static/source/globals.css -o ./backend/static/dist/tailwind.css --watch"
  },
```
 
In here you also see another command: tailwind. By calling ``bun run tailwind`` we can transpile our
``globals.css`` file to create ``output.css`` .

It is imported in our ``_base.html``, snce this is our Base Template, ``output.css`` is used in HTML file 
that inherits from it. 

Open ``tailwind.config.js`` in root. Here we can see that Tailwind scans our ``backend/templates`` folder for HTML and
``backend/static/source`` for JS, for tracking which classes are used and only including them in the output file. 
On a side note: ``globals.css`` also holds custom defined CSS for styling most of ``base.html``.

``` js, tailwind.config.js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./backend/static/source/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    "./backend/templates/**/*.{html}"
  ],
}
```

Another thing you might notice is the ``nginx`` folder, which holds all the Configuration for our web server. 
At the root you can see the Dockerfile for that.
When building, Docker copies the static files and serves them through Nginx
instead of our Flask application, since this is way more efficient.

Besides that we have a ``docker-compose.yml`` and ``serverless.yml`` file, you will learn about them in our deployment 
chapters.

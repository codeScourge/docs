As a Flask developer you will immediately notice familiar patterns in the ./backend folder:
- static holds your CSS and js
- templates holds your HTML which is rendered by Jinja
a (link to whitepaper). These allow us to inject
information directly into our HTML (and even JS), which allows for SSR (Serverside Rendering) just 
like Next

Also inside our backend folder are
- our Flask application in ``app.py``
- blueprints and other Python files
- (This one you need to create) ``.env`` file to store secrets
- a ``requirements.txt`` file
- a ``gunicorn_config.py`` file which configures our Gunicorn WSGI
- a Dockerfile to containarize the application for easier development and deployment

Inside our static folder we see another familiar pattern, this time for JavaScript developers: src (source) and
dist (distination). When bundling our JavaScript, the raw code is being transpiled into a clean bundle and 
copied from src to dist. After that we can simply import it into our HTML just like any other JavaScript.

Well how do we do it? For that open ``bundle.js`` in our root directory. Here we can see how Bun
tracks certain JavaScript files and bundles them into our dist directory while keeping the same name.

# Code Snippet of bundle.js

You can try this by simply running this file with ``bun build.js``. However, this is also defined as a
script in our ``package.json`` and can be run using ``bun run build``.

In here you also see another command: tailwind. By calling ``bun run tailwind`` we can transpile our
``globals.css`` file to create an ``output.css`` files which is imported in our ``_base.html``. Since
this is our Base Template, this CSS file is present in every other HTML file that inherits from it. The
Configuration for out Tailwind is done in ``tailwind.config.js`` in root. Here we can see that Tailwind 
scans our Templates for HTML and our Static for JS to only add classes that are actually used. On a side 
note: The globals.css also holds custom defined CSS, this is also added and applied.

Another thing you might notice is the nginx folder. This holds all the Configuration 
for our web server. At the root you can see another Dockerfile which is used for Nginx.
What is does besides setting up, is copying the static folder and serving it through Nginx
instead of our Flask application, since this is way more efficient.

The ``docker-compose.yml`` is a way of managing multiple containers and their interactions.

>*Please read the entire documentation from start to back. It is only 12 pages and will make sure you will have
the best experience working with this boilerplate. It is designed to be like a course, read it chapter by chapter.
Open the documentation and the repository side-by-side, I will guide you through the code
so you will master this techstack and workflow in no time!*


### The problem we have
In recent years the Web Development landscape has changed drastically: ever newer tools 
allow for easier and faster shipment of your application. On the forefront: JavaScript.
Everyone else however, is being left behind. In a world where you can get a NextJS
application up and running with ONE command, we have to fight to set up Webpack or give up and
live with vanilla JavaScript. 

The same is true for deployment: connect your repository to Vercel, and you have a fully managed 
application running with everything you could ever need. But thats boring, I would rather
dockerize my applications, setup Nginx and Gunicorn, Deploy everything to AWS while figuring out which of
more than 200 services I need to use. Don't forget about domains, oh and also ... just like ...

You see where I am going. While the temptation to take the JavaScript pill is high, Python is still my backend of choice.
It has giant ecosystem of libraries, is widely supported and can be made very performant through 
integration of C and simple hardware acceleration. Especially with the wide adoption of AI these aspects 
are becoming ever more important.


### How this solves the problem
So what is this, and how does it solve these problems?
This is all the boilerplate you will ever need for a Product, not just a Project. Besides the development
environment which allows you to quickly develop using Flask, ReactJS, ES-build, and PostCSS , it has:
- **database**
- **authentification**
- **payments**
- **emails**

Obviosly you don't want to self-host this application on your laptop. That is why
everything is configured so you can quickly and cheaply deploy to AWS - 
both orchestrated Docker containers (soon) and serverless Lambda functions are supported.

### Prerequisites
What do you need to know before you start? I expect you to be a Flask developer familiar with modern 
JavaScript: you need to know how package managers and bundling work. You should also know how Flask, WSGIs and 
web servers interact under the hood.
Thats it, you can choose you own frontend! 
Throughout this documentation I am going to teach you and help you setup:
- what advantages **NoSQL databases** and *DynamoDB* bring
- how **authentification** works using **OAuth**
- how to do **payments** using **Stripe**
- how to deploy to AWS using **Docker** and the **"Serverless Framework"**
- how to manage **domains** on AWS
- how to use **SES** to cheaply send emails 
so you can effectively use and customize this boilerplate with confidence

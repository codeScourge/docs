title: "Payments"
---

If you want to make money, you need to charge users. Thankfully, this is as easy as ever. Providers like 
Stripe take care of processing payments with any method imaginable. Simply create an account on Stripe, this
will have test mode enabled by default, meaning you can pay here without being charged. Also make sure you have
the Stripe CLI (see installation) installed, we will need it later

Once again, we don't have to build our own page.
We Simply redirect the user to Stripe, where he can pay and come back to our site. 

In the background, stripe will charge the user, and will inform us when certain events like
a successfull or canceled payment happens, by communicating with our webhook. A webhook is simply said
an endpoint where Stripe can send a request to. Open ``payment_bp.py`` and take a look at the "/stripe/webhook" route:

```python payment_bp.py
# --- Webhook ---
@payment_bp.post("/stripe/webhook")
def stripeWebhookRoute():
    payload = request.data
    sig_header = request.headers['STRIPE_SIGNATURE']


    # verify event signature (so that only stripe can send you events)
    try:
        event = stripe.Webhook.construct_event(payload, sig_header, os.getenv("STRIPE_ENDPOINT_SECRET"))
    except ValueError as e:
        raise f"Invalid Payload: {e}"
    except stripe.error.SignatureVerificationError as e:
        raise f"Invalid Signature: {e}"
    

    # handle events
    ...

    elif event["type"] == "checkout.session.completed":
        package_id = event["data"]["object"]["metadata"]["package_id"]
        email = event["data"]["object"]["metadata"]["email"]
        info_log(f"Webhook received, that user with email {email} has bought package number {package_id}")
        set_user_package(email, package_id)
        # TODO: email to user about success

    elif event["type"] in ["charge.failed", "payment_intent.failed"]:
        # TODO: email to user about failure
        pass

    else:
      error_log('Unhandled event type {}'.format(event['type']))


    return jsonify(success=True)
```

Here we receive a message from Stripe and first validate it using our STRIPE_ENDPOINT_SECRET, which you will
have to set inside ``.env``. This ensures, that only Stripe can send to this endpoint and mark our user as payed,
which we do in our ``set_user_package`` function. As you can see, we can retrieve information about 
- which user has bought something (email)
- which package that user has bought (package_id)

Both of this is set when creating the Checkout Session in "/checkout":

```python payment_bp.py
@payment_bp.get("/checkout/<int:package_id>")
@login_required
def checkoutRoute(package_id:int=1):
    # check if already bought something
    _, payed = check_user_status()
    if payed:
        info_log("User has already payed")
        return redirect("/home/payed")
    

    email = session.get("email")
    info_log(f"Creating Checkout for user with email {email} buying package number {package_id}")


    checkout_session = stripe.checkout.Session.create(
        payment_method_types=["card", "paypal"],
        line_items=[{"price": stripe_packages[package_id], "quantity": 1}],
        mode="payment",
        success_url=f"{request.host_url}payment/thanks" + "?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}",
        cancel_url=f"{request.host_url}payment/cancel",
        metadata={
            "email": email,
            "package_id": package_id
        }
    )

    return redirect(checkout_session.url)
``` 

What is also interesting is the line_items key. Here we will need to provide an id of an item which we create in Stripe
under More -> Product Catalog

<img src="../images/stripe_catalog.png"/>

Once you have created two products (one for each package) and have thereby set information such as price, you can
add it to our ``stripe_packages`` array and map the items to their "package_ids"

```python payment_bp.py
stripe_packages = {
    1: "price_1P2XOJHiXO1FchHrFQov9nyc",
    2: "price_1P3JpiHiXO1FchHrY4BbhmXW"
}
```

Lets get back to the webhook part. How does Stripe know where it is located? Once you have deployed your application at it
is accessible on the World Wide Web (www), you can set the IP or domain name of it inside the Stripe Settings. While we work
locally, however, we will use a technique called pooling. This means we will regularly ping the Stripe servers and see if any
updates came through. This is made possible using the Stripe CLI.
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8080/payment/stripe/webhook
```
This command will forward the Stripe Requests to our application running locally on port 8080. Note that this is the case
when running locally using ``bash local.sh`` and not while inside Docker (see structure).

As you might remember, we used the ``send_email`` functions to notify the user about his payments going through or being
cancelled. Read the next chapter on emails to see how we accomplish this

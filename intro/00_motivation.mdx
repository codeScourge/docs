title: "Introduction and Motivation"

In recent years the Web Development landscape has changed drastically: ever newer tools 
allow for easier and faster and shipment of your application, on the forefront: JavaScript.
Everyone else on the other hand is being left behind. In a world where you can get a NextJS
application up and running with ONE command, we have to fight to set up Webpack or give up and
live with vanilla JavaScript. 

The same is true for deployment: connect your repository to Vercel, and you have a fully managed 
application running with everything you could ever need. But thats boring, I would rather
dockerize my applications, setup Nginx and Gunicorn, Deploy everything to AWS while figuring out which of
more than 200 services I need to use. Don't forget about domains, oh and also ... just like ...

You see where I am going. While the temptation is high, I currently still prefer Python as my backend.
It has giant ecosystem of libraries, is widely supported and CAN be made very performant through 
integration of C and easy hardware acceleration. Since the wide adoption of AI these reasons are becoming
ever more important

So what is this, and how does it solve these problems?
This is all the boilerplate you will need for a whole Product, not Project. Besides the development
environment which allows you to quickly develop using Flask, ReactJS and Bun, it has:
- a databaseso you can save users
- payments so these can pay for your product
- authentification so they can access the bough product
- and (soon) emails so you can do marketing based on the analytics we are going to implement.

Obviosly you don't want to self-host this application on your laptop. That is why
everything is configured so you can quickly and cheaply deploy to AWS - doesn't matter if you want
microservices through orchestrated Docker containers or serverless Lambda functions.

### Prerequisites
What do you need to know before you start? I expect you to be a Flask developer familiar with modern 
JavaScript: you need to know how package managers and bundling work. Specifically you should know ReactJS
and optionally (but highly recommend) TailwindCSS. 

# (* add plug here to my course *)

You should also know the basics of how data is stored with databases.

In the later parts of this documentation I am going to teach you the following concepts and how
they are used in this
boilerplate, so you can confidentaly use and customize them:
- the NoSQL database DynamoDB
- how authentification works
- payments using Stripe
- deployment on AWS

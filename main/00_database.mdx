title: "Database"

The database is still something I am very unsure about. When I started out I used the underlying PostgreSQL
database from Supabase, but when I switched away from it I had a choice to make: keep using RDB
(Relational Database) or switch to NoSQL. In future I will add both options, 
so you have freedom of choice, but for now
we are going to use DynamoDB (link to whitepaper), let me tell you why. 

1. It is faster and more reliable than a RDB since it is optimized for modern compute, not storage
2. It is dirt cheap and scales to the moon
3. It integrates well into the rest of our AWS deployment stack
4. It is perfect for our architecture
